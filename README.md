# Deep-learning-model-based-Spam-email-detector
In this project, different deep learning frameworks are applied to detect spam email. In the experiment, the performance of those models is compared, including Na√Øve Bayes classifier, CNN  (convolutional neural network), RNN (recurrent neural network), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks) and CNN-LSTM. Results on CSDMC2010 SPAM corpus [2] indicate that stacked LSTM achieved 99.20% detection accuracy, which is much better than other machine learning algorithms for the problem.
